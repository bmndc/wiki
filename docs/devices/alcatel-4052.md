In mid-September 2019, after a series of trial models, Alcatel launched "two" new flip phones in the US market, in partnership with T-Mobile and AT&T. Both the Alcatel Go Flip 3 and the Alcatel SMARTFLIP are affordable devices that support 4G LTE connectivity on each network. Running on the same KaiOS 2.5.2 as the internationally-acclaimed Nokia 2720 Flip, people in the US can now enjoy some of the best KaiOS features such as WhatsApp messaging and voice dictation with a simplified version of Google Assistant.

Note that despite having different names and [multiple variants being released under different carriers](https://www.reddit.com/r/dumbphones/comments/lu36eh/alcatel_go_flip_3_4052_o_variant/), all variants are basically the same device, with the receiving LTE bands tailored to each of the carriers.

## Tips and tricks
- To take a screenshot, press both * and # keys simultaneously.
- This phone includes a screen reader feature that's hidden by default, possibly because some third-party apps did not label their buttons correctly. To toggle the hidden Readout feature, press both the volume keys repeatedly until you hear a robotic sound.

## Secret codes
*Tip: You can save these codes as contacts for quick dialing later. When the phone suggests a saved code, you'll have to press Call to activate the code's function.*

Big thanks to [u/dhruvkar on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/KaiOS/comments/hav4qp/comment/fv5lw7p/?context=3) for pulling the system apps on his SMARTFLIP and documenting this list of secret codes. Note that some codes here may not work in normal userspace: if you happen to also have a Go Flip 3 or SMARTFLIP and stumble when dialing any of these codes, please let me know!

- `*#*#33284#*#*`: Toggle debugging mode, allowing the phone to be accessed with ADB (more on this later). A bug will appear in the status bar letting you know debugging mode is on.
- `*#*#28865625#*#*`: Display a pop-up allowing you to enter Device unlock code to free the phone from network restrictions.
- `#865625#`/`#825625688#`: Attempt to unlock the phone from network restrictions.
- `*#*#3646633#*#*`: Switch network types between LTE, GSM, WCDMA and Automatic. This can also be toggled under Settings, Network & Connectivity, Mobile network & Data.
- `*#06#`: Display the hidden International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) on GSM networks and SVN numbers. Do not show them to anyone else: they're crucial for calling functions on the phone.
- `##6343#`: Display the Mobile Equipment Identifier (MEID) number to uniquely identify a specific cell phone on CDMA networks.
- `*#07#`: Open More information page under Settings, Device, Device information.
- `*#16#`: Check the `ro.sar.enabled` property, if enabled check the current SAR level and display SAR-related health and safety information.
- `*#33#` (call): Check the [Call barring](https://www.communityphone.org/blogs/call-barring) service status from carrier for blocking or whitelisting calls, whether incoming or outgoing, domestic or international. Requires a 4-digit passcode to use. To toggle, go to Settings, Network & Connectivity, Calling, Call barring.
- `*#43#` (call): Check the [Call waiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_waiting) service status from carrier. To toggle, go to Settings, Network & Connectivity, Calling, Call waiting.
- `*#2886#`: Open KaiOS MMI Test, an internal tool to test hardware performance of a KaiOS device through an automatic routine or manually by hand, including LCD backlight, T9 keyboard, camera, LED flash, RTC, speaker, microphone, vibrator, 3.5mm audio jack, SIM trays, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, microSD and microUSB slots etc.
- `*#3228#`: Display internal version numbers of system partitions such as /boot, /system, /recovery, /modem and the bootloader.
- `*#4636#`: Display the production code, hardware revision and software build number.
- `*#7810#`/`##4382#`: Open Wireless Emergency Alerts settings under Settings, Network & Connectivity, allowing to toggle if you want to receive Required Monthly Test, Exercise Alert or Commercial Mobile Service Providers (CMSP) Alert from the government, specifically the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
- `*#*#825364#*#*`: Toggle Power Saving Mode under Settings, Device, Battery, which would turn off Wi-Fi, mobile data and Bluetooth to reserve remaining battery juice.
- `*#8378269#`/`*#*#2637643#*#*`: Open Testbox engineering menu with predecessor Firefox OS design,  usually used by OEMs to test various hardware of the phone.
- `###232#`: Check the total call duration since the phone was last turned on.
- `###3424#`: Open a menu, allowing to toggle Qualcomm diagnostic port and serial port for fixing null/invalid IMEI or baseband via QPST.
- `*#*#123321#*#*`: DM Configuration (?)
- `##66236#`: Edit DMAcc (?)

Codes that don't work/Unknown codes
{:.text-delta}

- `*#*#86583#*#*`
- `*#*#9663223#*#*`
