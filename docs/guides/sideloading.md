# Sideloading and debugging

According to How-To Geek, sideloading is 'the practice of installing software on a device without using the approved app store or software distribution channel'. You may want to do so because you found a cool piece of software is not in the device's app store, either because it doesn't meet the app store's standards, it's not available in your country, or you're a developer and looking to test your app before making it public.

This is where Android Debug Bridge (ADB) and WebIDE comes in. Every electronic device has some special protocols for developers and engineers to communicate and do special operations, like sideloading apps, and KaiOS devices are no different. ADB and WebIDE are handy tools for engineers to decode those protocols.

There are also other alternative methods to choose from.
